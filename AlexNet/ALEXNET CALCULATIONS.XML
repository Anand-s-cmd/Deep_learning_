when filter size is 3*3
number of kernels is 10---->image size is 27*27 then next feature map dimension is n-f+1----------> 27-3+1=25-> 25*25
next if stride is given 2*2 then 10 featuremaps are created now next featuremap dimensionis ->(25-3/2)+1-> 12
if pad is given pad=2 then ---> (25+2*2-3/stride(value))+1


DIFF BETWEEN LENET 													& ALEXNET

1. NO OF LAYERS WAS NOT HUGE                                       1. MORE NUMBER O LAYERS
2. KERNEL SIZE WAS constant										   2. HERE THEY HAVE USED DIFFERENT KIND OF SIZES LIKE FROM 96 TO 256-384-384-256-256
3. HERE THEY HAVE USED HYPERTANGENT FUNCTION I,E TANH()		       3. THEY HAVE USED RELU
   INSTEAD OF RELU
4. THEY HAVE NOT USED ANY NORMALIZATION FUNCTION TO CONTROL        4. THEY HAVE USED TO CONTROL THE RELU FUNCTION VALUES -
   TANH VALUES														  LOCAL RESPONSE NORMALIZATION FOR HANDLING DATA 
                                                                   5. FIRST TIME THEY HAVE USED GPU
